        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi! I'm chethan, a dedicated web developer and educator who believes that coding is a tool everyone should have the opportunity to learn. With several years of experience in web development, I specialize in creating dynamic and responsive websites, working with modern technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.

            As someone who has always enjoyed sharing knowledge, I also provide personalized coding lessons designed to simplify complex programming concepts and make learning enjoyable. My teaching approach is hands-on and interactive, aiming to equip students with real-world skills and the confidence to tackle projects independently.
            
            I’m passionate about making technology accessible to everyone, whether you're a beginner learning the basics or an aspiring developer looking to advance your skills. Through my work and lessons, I strive to foster a learning environment where students can thrive and turn their curiosity into mastery.</p>
